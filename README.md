# Would You Rather Game App

Would You Rather Game App is a game of choice which allows the users/players of the application to choose one from two options from questions asked by other users/players, create their own questions, see statistics of questions answered and unanswered. A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. The app users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. 

The application was built with React.js while the state was managed by Redux and Redux Thunk for side effects.
